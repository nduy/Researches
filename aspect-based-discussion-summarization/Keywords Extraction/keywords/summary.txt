The vast majority of comments were very negative towards the changes to bin collections. 

The only positive comments were that it would be a good move for recycling. Littlerichie thought it was a good idea to force people to recycle more. They said: "If 75% of this borough composted their waste at home then they could have their bins collected every six-weeks." Other people said that they managed fine as they were, and many said that they did not put their bins out every time there was a collection. 

Far more people were angry with the proposals. There were several comments about vermin. People said that rubbish left for three weeks would attract rats and foxes. Others said it should not be an issue because people with compost bins do not have more vermin than others.

Lots of people compared their waste with others. Some showed off about the high amount of recycling that they managed to do. Parents with babies had big issues over disposing soiled nappies. There was a debate over which type of nappy was better for the environment. 

A few people talked about the issues with throwing away rubbish in large communal housing. However, someone pointed out that the article says that flats will get different circumstances. 

Many people blamed the Council for the cuts to waste services. Few people identified that the 50% cuts were imposed by central government, that local Councils then had to implement.
