It is such acceleration (that is not smooth, as it is affected by the roughly 11 year solar cycles) that tells you that the planet is warming beyond its natural cycle. That excess warming is what the greenhouse effect of industrial CO2 emissions explains.

            "label": "Doug, I have tried to teach you (across websites) about climate change for some time now, and you still don't learn. So, once again. Denialists start their \"hiatus\" in 1998 (an El Nino year with record high annual value of temperature anomaly). Following 1998 we were on the descending curve of a solar cycle, that lasts about 11 years. This is recurrent, and during the accelerated phase of global warming there have been previous periods of periodical slow downs in warming associated with solar cycle minima. Now, the 1998 temperature anomaly record was broken in 2010, that is 12 years later, thus signalling the end of the low phase of the solar cycle and the initiation of the higher radiation phase. Therefore the accelerated phase is back on track. Your \"18 years without accelerated warming\" is just a lie, please just stop repeating lies. Moreover, during the \"hiatus\" the trend has always been towards warming, although at a decreased rate for the reason I explained above. There has been NO overall cooling during that period. Denialists just like to scavenge for small periods of temporary cooling to prove their point, that only demonstrate that they are scavengers of ad hoc, cherry picked evidence. Real scientists know and use the full information available: the inter-decadal records of temperature anomaly show relentless warming. While you keep on waiting and crossing your fingers for the Little Ice Age to come ask the farmers of Australia how is that climate going for them.... See you in January 2015 for the temperature anomaly of 2014: The hiatus is over!",

As freshwater ice melts (because of global warming), it decreases salinity around the coast thus increasing the freezing point temperature, therefore favouring the appearance of sea ice even under global warming conditions. There are other likely factors as well to explain the difference, but that's a pretty obvious one.",

What would you call that, if not climate change? Ice melt? We're currently losing well over a trillion tonnes of ice each decade from the Antarctic and Greenland ice shelves, the two main continental ice reserves on the planet; the summer Arctic sea ice may well be gone within a few short years; amost every glacier on the planet is in full retreat. Here in Australia, the exacerbation of drought conditions over the past thirty or forty years has been linked by careful research and detailed meteorological observations to a change in Southern Ocean currents and wind systems connected to -- spoiler alert -- climate change. Moisture-bearing air just isn't being delivered to the southern half of the continent in the way that it used to be, and all the indications are that this situation is going to deteriorate further as the currents which could help us move further offshore in response to the warming atmosphere. This almost certainly means yet worse droughts, yet worse fire seasons -- oh, I forgot, Tiny Habit has reminded us there's no connection between climate change and bushfire. Silly me. Proof? You're thinking of mathematics, perhaps. Science doesn't deal in proof. It deals in evidence, and there's that in abundance. I'd suggest you open your eyes. And lay off the scare quotes.",

Any extended period over 35C will induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible. While this never happens in the natural environment now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7C, while with 11-12C warming such regions would encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. While central estimates of business-as-usual warming by 2100 are 3-4C, eventual warming of 10C is quite feasible and even 20C is theoretically possible. Artificial climate means it will happen much sooner. Manila, like most modern cities, is already several degrees warmer than surrounding areas in the day and is stifling at night because of the urban heat-island effect, which releases the heat stored in concrete, roads and buildings at night. \"A 4C rise in temperature will make life unbearable and air-conditioning an absolute necessity. Air conditioning, for instance, is no remedy - power demand would soar, it would be unaffordable for billions in the third world and for protection of most livestock, it would not help the biosphere or protect outside workers, it would regularly imprison people in their homes, and power failures would become life-threatening.  Complicating the daytime heat extreme are nights that are insufficient cooler. Heatwaves in regions unaccustomed to them will kill lots of people. Vulnerable people, such as children and the elderly, are especially susceptible to heatwaves. in such circumstances, their health problems amplify very quickly.",
